        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p><strong>Hello everyone,</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Amal Deis, and I am running to be your next DGSS President. As the MBA1 Class Representative, I made a clear promise to listen, to act, and to advocate for my cohort. I delivered on that promise. I strengthened inter-program connection, raised concerns about the barriers non-Francophone students face in recruiting, and worked to ensure that every MBA student felt supported, heard, and represented.</p>
        <p>I am now ready to bring that same determination, focus, and follow-through to all Desautels Masters programs. Our community deserves leadership that is present, informed, and accountable. Leadership that communicates with transparency, creates meaningful collaboration across programs, and transforms student feedback into real solutions. These are the principles that guide my platform: strengthening our community, improving transparency, and expanding opportunities for everyone.</p>
        <p>I care about making promises I can keep, and that's why I've already begun taking concrete steps on these matters (such as confirming intentions for a lounge!). As DGSS president, I know we could get even more done together. If elected, I will lead with intention, integrity, and action. I will be a President who responds to your needs, represents your voice, and delivers results you can see and feel across Desautels.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Voice, My Action.</strong></p>
        <p>Thank you.</p>
